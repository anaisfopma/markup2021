This Shiny app plots the average life expectancy in countries against their GDP per capita, using the Gapminder dataset available in the gapminder package. It generates simplified versions of the graphs developed by Gapminder by sizing the countries according to their populations. The user can select a year from 1952 to 2007 and see the corresponding information for each country by hovering over the graph that is displayed.
